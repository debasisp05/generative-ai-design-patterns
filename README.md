# generative-ai-design-patterns
A [catalog](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lakshmanok/generative-ai-design-patterns/blob/main/catalog.html) of design patterns when building generative AI applications

## Too early for a book
Design Patterns are common solutions to recurring problems. The solutions are not perfect - each of them comes with tradeoffs and a choice of one often brings about new problems that need to be addressed. So, an experienced practitioner will have to be pragmatic when choosing among these solutions.

Because I co-authored the O'Reilly book [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-Preparation/dp/1098115783), I frequently get asked whether I plan to update the book to add GenAI design patterns. 
I believe it's too early for a book -- see my [Article on Medium](https://medium.com/@lakshmanok/generative-ai-design-patterns-8eb1d937fccc) for why I think so,
but in short, there is too much we don't yet know about GenAI in production and a lot of hype with no evidence.

## Why this catalog?
Even though it's too early to make it a book that needs to remain relevant for a few years, it's also clear that there is a need to capture what today's best practices are.
My hope is that this living catalog on GitHub can help cut through the noise and point to where improvements are happening.

You can find the catalog on GitHub here:
https://github.com/lakshmanok/generative-ai-design-patterns/blob/main/catalog.html
and [preview it using this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lakshmanok/generative-ai-design-patterns/blob/main/catalog.html).

## How to contribute?
The catalog will continue to be updated, so star the GitHub repo and/or bookmark the webpage.

Also, I think of this as a community catalog. So, please do feel free to file issues if you wish to start a discussion or create a pull-request if you wish to suggest an addition.

Once the catalog stabilizes (whether in a few months or in a few years), I'll reach out to the top contributors about collaborating on making it a book.
